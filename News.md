- Our dev build now has INMP441 (digital microphone) support for the ESP32.
- Our dev build also has a Gain settings control for volume reactive or '*' routines.
- Neither update have been rolled up into our main branch.
- We've had a lot of issues with AP mode and ESP8266's, so Andrew created an ESP8266 branch, downloaded the latest version of WLED and added just the volume reactive functionality to that branch.
- We'll be removing ESP8266 support from our dev and main branches over time. That will simplify coding significantly.
- apleschu is still busy with his cross continental move.
