- Our dev build now has INMP441 support for the ESP32 as well as Gain settings control for volume reactive ('*") routines.
- That has not yet been rolled up into main.
- We've had a lot of issues with AP mode and ESP8266's, so Andrew re-created the volume reactive only version for ESP8266's from the 'latest' version of WLED. It's called the ESP866 branch.
- We'll be removing ESP8266 support from our dev and main branches over time. That will simplify coding significantly.
- apleschu is still busy with his cross continental move.
