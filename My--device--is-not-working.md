If you'd like some help with your device, these are the types of things we would be asking:

* Are you all wired up OK?
* Does the the release from wled.me work?
* Are you using our 'MASTER' release?
* Did you use the most recent 'MASTER' release?
* Are you using an ESP8266 or ESP32?
* Is your device working in AP mode?
* Which IDE are you using?
* Exactly which device and LED's are you using?
* Is it just sound reactivity that doesn't work?
* If just sound reactivity, are you using one of our approved microphones?
* Have you tested that microphone with a basic sound sampling sketch?
* If it's a compile error, can you provide the errors?
* Have you made any changes to the source?
* If your bootloader is broken, the binary may not load. Try the one from wled.me first.
* Can you document the steps to re-create that crash?
* Make sure your grounds are all connected together.
