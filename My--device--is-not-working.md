If you'd like some help with your device, these are the types of things we would be asking:

* Please provide a clear and concise description of the problem and the environment.
* If you are referring to code, please provide a link to the version you are referring to.
* Is your audio all wired up OK? See [here](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/wiki/Audio-Input-Options).
* How about power? Lots of LED's require lots of power and a common ground for everything.
* Does the [latest release from WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases/latest) work?
* Are you using our most recent 'MASTER' release?
* Have you tried flashing [our latest release](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/releases/latest)?
* Are you using an ESP8266 or ESP32?
* Is your device working in AP mode?
* Which IDE are you using?
* Which microphone/input are you using and how is it configured?
* Is it just sound reactivity that doesn't work?
* If just sound reactivity, are you using one of our [approved microphone configurations](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/wiki/Audio-Input-Options)?
* Have you tested that microphone with a [basic sound sampling sketch](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/wiki/Basic-Sound-Sampling-Sketch-Example)?
* If it's a compile error, can you provide the errors?
* Have you made any changes to the source?
* If your bootloader is broken, the binary may not load. Try the one from wled.me first.
* Can you document the steps to re-create that error?
* Make sure your grounds are all connected together.
* If you're using our 'dev' branch, don't forget to make a fresh 'pull'.
