During our journey with WLED, we've sometimes been unable to connect to one or more of our devices and/or lost connectivity to one. Here's some things to try:

1. Wipe (using pyflasher) and re-flash your device.
2. For more reliable connectivity on Android, you need to go into WiFi advanced settings (press 3 dots at top right of WiFi page), and disable 'Switch to mobile data', as well as 'Wi-Fi power saving mode'.
3. Ensure you have a strong signal to the device.
