We've had a lot of fun creating our audio reactive fork of WLED, and we've got more to come.

## Wish List
| Topic  | Notes | Skills Required |
| ------------- | ------------- |-- |
| Dynamic FFT sliders  | Allow additional sliders to be hidden by default, or displayed depending on the effect.  | Javascript, XML, JSON, HTML, CSS |
| Improved default values for sliders | Allow improved default values for sliders and on a per SEGMENT basis. | Javascript, XML, JSON, HTML |
| UDP sound synchronization  | Ability to send sound information to other devices  | Networking, C |
| FastLED back end | Would like to swap out NeoPixelBus with a FastLED back end that supports RGBW and DMA output for ESP8266 | C, System |
| Add 2D Library support | Add a full 2D library for FastLED functionality | C, System |
| Add SEGMENT support for 2D | Improve SEGMENT capabilities | Everything |
| Improved/documented QA process | We need to be able to better test our significant updates. A test/release plan would be a good start. | |
