### Example Wiring Schematic

The following diagram shows one way of connecting a 3.5mm jack and a MAX9814 Microphone to the ESP8266/32 while being able to change your desired input with a simple SPDT switch.

The left and right channels of the TRS Jack are connected together to sample both channels simultaneously as one channel.
