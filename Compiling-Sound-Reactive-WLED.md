## ESP8266
We have provided support for volume reactive animations, as well as any new 1D animations.

## ESP32
In addition to the above support, the ESP32 platform also supports FFT (frequency) reactive as well as 2D animations.

## Platform IO
Some of our developers are using Platform IO, and have updated our repository to support it.

## Arduino IDE
We are still using the traditional Arduino IDE, versions 1.8.10 and 1.8.12. Old people with old habits.
