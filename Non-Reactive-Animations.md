## New Animations

New animations have been added that support palettes as well as the default colours, including the RGBW supported white channel.

### Phased
A spring-like effect using changing phases of sine waves.
* Speed - Adjust the speed of the animation.
* Intensity - Adjust the number of pixels displayed.
* FFT1 - Adjusts length of each section.

### Phased Noise
A spring-like effect using changing phases of sine waves, with perlin noise varying the length of each section.
* Speed - Adjust the speed of the animation.
* Intensity - Adjust the number of pixels displayed.

### Twinkleup
An 8 line random fade-in/out routine that's a fraction of the size of the others.

* Speed - Adjust the speed of the animation.
* Intensity - Adjust percentage of animated pixels.

### Noisepal
A slow and soothing noise routine with palettes that slowly change on the fly. This does not have any controls. It's based on my old Noise routine at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjoDkqoU5Fk

### Sinewave
A moving sine wave with a lot of controls.
* Speed - Adjust the speed of the animation.
* Intensity - Adjust PWM width of the wave.
* FFT1 - Adjust the rate of color change.
* FFT2 - Adjust the frequency of the sine wave.
